### My Notebooks going through the Stanford CS229 course (Autumn 2018)

Lecture 1 is missing since that was just an intro for Stanford students to the class.
In the notebooks, I may try to attempt my own solution for a problem based on prior knowledge but not all of the notebooks will have these.

I link to the data sets used as Python comments.
My juypter notebooks are written locally using Python3.11
